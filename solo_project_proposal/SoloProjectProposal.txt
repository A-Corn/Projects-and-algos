 Project Description: The ultimate One Piece Devil Fruit API. Anyone can add to this api since theres so many devil fruits in the show that have and have not been mentioned.
 
New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: TailwindCSS

Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2): The dashboard will show all of the devil fruits.

Week 2 Features (to show at the first office hour/lecture of Week 3): users can search for devil fruits by name or by the type of devil fruit they are looking for. 


Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...): When users sign up they will havbe the option to favorite their favorite devil fruits for easy access
